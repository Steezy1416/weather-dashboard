## How it started...

Before I started any coding I wanted to draw out the layout I had in mind. This proved to be very helpful because it help me plan out the html and get an idea of what would be DOM elements.

Then I started planning out the basic logic so the weather dashboard would actually work. Spoiler alert it was more complicated than I initially thought but writting it down still proved to be useful.
